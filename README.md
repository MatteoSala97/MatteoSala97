🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm Matteo, an Italian 🇮🇹 Odoo Developer & Web Designer with a passion for crafting intuitive digital experiences. My journey into web development started with a 6-month online tech academy course, where I mastered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Since then, I've been constantly refining my skills, embracing new challenges, and pushing the limits of what’s possible.

Outside of work, you'll often find me snowboarding 🏂 in the winter, playing volleyball 🏐, or diving into video games 🎮. Oh, and I have two amazing dogs who keep life interesting! 🐶🐶


🔭 What I'm Working On

Since October 1, 2024, I've been part of an Odoo-focused company, where we specialize in custom ERP solutions that help businesses streamline their processes. We’re proud to be Gold Partners—the first in our area 🥇—delivering cutting-edge Odoo implementations tailored to each client’s needs.

My role involves:


🔹 Developing custom Odoo modules to improve business efficiency

🔹 Creating modern, user-friendly designs for Odoo-based applications

🔹 Teaching Odoo and its ways to boost your company



We recently transitioned into using Odoo's Enterprise ecosystem, and I’m excited to push its capabilities to the max. While I’m still mastering Python and XML, the journey has been incredibly rewarding and we're already achieving big results! 🚀

💡 I'm always open to collaborations, knowledge sharing, and new challenges in the Odoo ecosystem. If you're working on something cool, let's connect! 🔧📈
